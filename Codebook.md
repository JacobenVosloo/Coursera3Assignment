<h3> Introduction and Background </h2>
<p>  The data table found in summaryData.txt is an output of measured data summarized using the run_analysis.R script found in this folder. This script calculated the averages of the mean and standard deviation of the accelerometer measurements in X,Y and Z axis and grouped them by subject and activity type.
 </p>
 
 <p> 
This code book gives a explanation for each variable measured in the tidy data set
 </p>

<h3> Field explanations </h3>
1. Subject - Integer  <br/>
      Gives the subject number from which the measurement was taken
2. Activity - Text <br/>
      A description of the activity performed by the subject
3. meanX - numeric <br/>
      The average of the mean accelerometer measurement in the X-axis during this acitivity for the specific subject
4. meanY- numeric <br/>
      The average of the mean accelerometer measurement in the Y-axis during this acitivity for the specific subject
5. meanZ- numeric <br/>
      The average of the mean accelerometer measurement in the Z-axis during this acitivity for the specific subject
6. stdX- numeric <br/>
      The average of the standard deviation accelerometer measurement in the X-axis during this acitivity for the specific subject
7. stdY- numeric <br/>
      The average of the standard deviation accelerometer measurement in the Y-axis during this acitivity for the specific subject
8. stdZ- numeric <br/>
      The average of the standard deviation accelerometer measurement in the Z-axis during this acitivity for the specific subject
